### Hello, I am Gerardo Valdez 👋🏼

I majored in Data Science and Statistics, and minored in Economics at Minerva Schools at the Keck Graduate Institute. I traveled, worked, and studied in seven different countries around the world 🇺🇸 🇰🇷 🇮🇳 🇩🇪 🇦🇷 🇬🇧 🇹🇼 throughout my college education. Since I was young, I always enjoyed solving problems and building things. Writing software gives me the same kind of enjoyment I had when I built my own catapult as a nine year old kid.

**Passions:** Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Robotics, Economics, Finance


## Coursework:

1. Causal Inference
2. Machine Learning

### [Causal Inference](#Causal-Inference) (using R, Python)

Using statistics to prove empirically a causal relationship, and calculating the true treatment effect.

    * Ensuring that the treatment and control group are similar pre-treatment
    * Minimizing the effect of unaccounted variables (i.e., confounding variables)
- **Counterfactuals**
    * Using statistics to estimate the result of being assigned to the opposite group
    * Calculating the true treatment effect
- **Multicollinearity, endogeneity**
    * Accounting for the possibility of variables and/or the error being correlated with each other
- **Hypothesis testing** 
    * RCTs, ANOVA, T-test, Fisher's test of independence, $\chi^{2}$ test, p-values
